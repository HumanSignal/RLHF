# How to align model with human feedback
This repository offers a comprehensive collection of tutorials, best practices, and valuable references for data-centric model development using the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methodology. As data scientist practitioners, our goal is to maintain transparency in the underlying mechanisms while primarily focusing on the effective collection and processing of data to align open-source foundational models with targeted objectives.

The data-centric RLHF model alignment journey consists of 3 key steps:

- [Establishing Supervised Model Baseline](#establishing-supervised-model-baseline)
- [Gathering and Incorporating Human Feedback](#gathering-and-incorporating-human-feedback)
- [Training and Assessing the Final Model with Reinforcement Learning](#training-and-assessing-the-final-model-with-reinforcement-learning)

## Establishing Supervised Model Baseline
In this step, we collect labeled text data to train an initial Large Language Model (LLM), focusing on task-specific performance improvements. This stage involves gathering instructions and responses to adapt the base model to a broad range of tasks, enhancing its ability to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses.
Typically this step involves:
- Selecting baseline Foundational Model (FM) that can perform fairly well on general tasks (like [GPT2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2) or [GPT-J](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b))
- Generate dataset of pairs prompt input followed by response. You can manually label dataset or generate the data like it is [provided in the example](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca)
- Peform supervised model finetuning.

## Gathering and Incorporating Human Feedback
This stage involves collecting comparison data to establish human preferences for the responses generated by the supervised model. By ranking multiple responses based on quality, we can train a reward model that effectively captures human preferences. This reward model plays a crucial role in reinforcement learning, optimizing the performance of the fine-tuned foundational model.

[Gathering Human Feedback Tutorial](tutorials/gathering_human_feedback.ipynb) - This Jupyter Notebook tutorial will guide you through the process of collecting comparison data, establishing human preferences, and incorporating this feedback into the reward model training.

## Training and Assessing the Final Model with Reinforcement Learning
The training stage is a challenging process, and the final model assessment is a critical component in evaluating your model's quality. It is essential to determine whether the model adheres to the provided instructions, avoids biases, and maintains a high standard of performance.
